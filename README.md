      In the Settings editor, users can search for specific settings, modify existing settings, and add new settings to personalize their VS Code experience. For example, users can change the theme by searching for “theme” and selecting a new theme from the list of available options. 
      
      Users can also change the font size by searching for “font.size” and adjusting the value. Additionally, users can customize keybindings by searching for “keybindings” and modifying the default keybindings or adding new ones.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Steps to set-up and start debugging

1. Open VS Code and navigate to the folder where you want to create the new file.
2. In the File menu, select “New File” or press Ctrl + N.
3. Name the new file with a .js extension, such as “main.js”.
4. Add sample code to the new file, like this:
console.log("Hello, World!");

Place a breakpoint in your code by clicking on the left margin of the editor next to the line number where you want to pause execution.
Open the Debug view by clicking on the debug icon in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window or by pressing F5.
In the Debug view, click on the “Create Launch Configuration” button in the top right corner.

In the “Create Configuration” dialog, select “Node.js (current directory)” as the launch configuration type and click “Create.”
Save the launch configuration file by clicking on the “…” button next to the “Launch” dropdown menu.
Press F5 or click on the “Run” button in the top right corner of the Debug view to start debugging.


Some key debugging features available in VS Code include:

*Breakpoints: Allow you to pause execution of your code at specific points.

*Watch Expressions: Enable you to evaluate expressions during debugging.

*Call Stack: Displays the stack, making it easier to understand the flow of your program.

*Variables: Provides tools to inspect and modify variables during debugging.
